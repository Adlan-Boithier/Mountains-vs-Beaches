We visualized the distribution of preferences and other key features, examined correlations, and built a predictive model using a Random Forest Classifier. The model achieved a reasonable accuracy, suggesting that demographic and lifestyle factors can indeed provide insights into travel preferences.\n","\n","For future analysis, it would be interesting to explore more sophisticated models or feature engineering techniques to improve prediction accuracy.
