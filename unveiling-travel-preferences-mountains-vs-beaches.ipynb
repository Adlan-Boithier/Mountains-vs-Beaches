We visualized the distribution of preferences and other key features, examined correlations, and built a predictive model using a Random Forest Classifier. The model achieved a reasonable accuracy, suggesting that demographic and lifestyle factors can indeed provide insights into travel preferences.\n\nFor future analysis, it would be interesting to explore more sophisticated models or feature engineering techniques to improve prediction accuracy. Additionally, incorporating external data sources, such as weather patterns or regional tourism statistics, could provide further context and enhance the model's predictive power.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Credits\nThis notebook was created with the help of [Devra AI data science assistant](https://devra.ai/ref/kaggle)","metadata":{}}]}
