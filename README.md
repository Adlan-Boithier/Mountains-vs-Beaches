# **Project Overview**
In this project, we analyze travel preferences between mountains and beaches based on demographic and lifestyle data, aiming to predict individual preferences.

## **Project Steps:**
- Data Preparation: Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset using pandas, handling missing values and preparing it for machine learning.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized relationships between demographic variables (e.g., age, income) and travel preferences using seaborn and matplotlib.
- Modeling: Built a RandomForestClassifier with scikit-learn to predict preferences between mountains and beaches.
- Evaluation: Assessed the model's performance using accuracy and a classification report. Identified key predictors like age and income.
- Future Improvements: Suggested refining the model with additional features and exploring other classifiers to further enhance accuracy.

## **Project Results:**
- Developed an initial RandomForest model with variable accuracy for predicting preferences.
- Improved model interpretability by analyzing the importance of demographic variables like age and income.
- Achieved a 99% accuracy rate, with the model performing better on certain demographic segments, offering insights for targeted marketing strategies.
